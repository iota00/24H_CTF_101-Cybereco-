# 24H CTF 101 Challenges

This repository contains solutions for the challenges of the 24H CTF 101 event organized by Cybereco, Banque Nationale Desjardins, Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, PolyHX, and Yogosha. 

## Introduction

The challenges cover various areas of security, including cryptography, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and blue team. The solutions provided here are intended to serve as a reference for participants who are interested in learning how to solve CTF challenges or who would like to compare their approaches with others.

## Usage

Each category of challenge has its own directory, and within each category directory, there are subdirectories for each challenge. The challenge directories contain a detailed description of the problem and the necessary files to solve it. The solutions provided are not the only way to solve the challenges, and there may be alternative approaches that are more efficient or elegant.

To use this repository, simply navigate to the category directory that interests you and choose the challenge you would like to attempt. Once you have solved the challenge, you can compare your approach to the solution provided in the directory.
